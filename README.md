# omok
omok is based on the traditional Japanese strategic board game "Gomoku" in which 2 players play on a 15x15 grid, the first player to get 5 in a row wins, inspiration is taken from the massively multiplayer online game Maplestory where I first discovered it as a minigame!
features real time private matchmaking and chat functionality!
